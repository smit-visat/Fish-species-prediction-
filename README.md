## Fish Market Classification Model
This repository contains a machine learning model developed for classifying fish species in a fish market dataset using the Random Forest algorithm.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify different fish species based on various features using the Fish Market dataset. The dataset includes common fish species found in fish markets, and the model is trained to predict the species of a fish given its attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Fish Market dataset. The dataset includes information about various fish species and their characteristics.

## Features
Species: The fish species (target variable).
Length1: Length of fish type 1 (in cm).
Length2: Length of fish type 2 (in cm).
Length3: Length of fish type 3 (in cm).
Height: Height of the fish (in cm).
Width: Width of the fish (in cm).
